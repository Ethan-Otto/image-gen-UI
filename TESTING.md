   - 10 tests for image upload
   - File upload, preview, mode selection

4. **cancel-functionality.spec.ts** (278 lines)
   - 10 tests for cancellation
   - Cancel button behavior, polling cleanup
   - Partial results preservation

5. **error-handling.spec.ts** (318 lines)
   - 12 tests for error scenarios
   - API errors, network failures, retries
   - Mixed success/error states

6. **download-features.spec.ts** (341 lines)
   - 10 tests for downloads
   - Download buttons, multiple downloads
   - Filename handling, download quality

7. **multi-tab-behavior.spec.ts** (376 lines)
   - 9 tests for multi-tab scenarios
   - Independent state, simultaneous generation
   - Tab isolation, refresh handling

8. **visual-regression.spec.ts** (381 lines)
   - 15 visual regression tests
   - Screenshots of all major UI states
   - Mobile/tablet viewports

**Total: 84 E2E tests** covering all major functionality

## Mock Strategy

All tests use **mocked Gemini API responses** - no real API calls!

Benefits:
- Fast execution (no network delays)
- Free (no API costs)
- Reliable (consistent results)
- Works offline

Mock fixtures in `tests/fixtures/`:
- `mockResponses.ts` - Predefined API responses
- `mockHelpers.ts` - Helper functions for mocking

## How to Run Tests

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (headless, fast)
npm run test:e2e

# Run with interactive UI (RECOMMENDED for development)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run in headed mode (see browser)
npm run test:e2e:headed

# Debug tests (step through with inspector)
npm run test:e2e:debug

# View HTML report of last test run
npm run test:e2e:report

# Generate test code interactively
npm run test:e2e:codegen
```

### Advanced Commands

```bash
# Run specific test file
npx playwright test basic-generation.spec.ts

# Run specific test by name
npx playwright test -g "should generate images"

# Run only on desktop browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run only on mobile
npx playwright test --project=mobile-chrome

# Update visual regression screenshots
npx playwright test --update-snapshots

# Run with verbose output
npx playwright test --reporter=list
```

## Configuration Highlights

From `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Auto web server** - Starts Next.js dev server automatically
- **Screenshots on failure** - Automatic debugging aid
- **Video recording** - Videos saved when tests fail
- **Visual regression** - Screenshot comparison built-in
- **Parallel execution** - Tests run in parallel for speed
- **Retry logic** - 2 retries on CI, 0 locally

## CI/CD Integration

GitHub Actions workflow created in `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`:

- Runs on push to main/master/develop
- Runs on pull requests
- Uploads test reports, screenshots, videos as artifacts
- 30-day retention for reports
- 7-day retention for failure videos/screenshots

To see results:
1. Push code to GitHub
2. Go to Actions tab
3. Click on workflow run
4. Download artifacts if tests fail

```

## Quick Examples

### Run all tests and see report
```bash
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Debug a failing test
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Update visual snapshots after UI change
```bash
npx playwright test visual-regression.spec.ts --update-snapshots
```

### Test mobile responsiveness
```bash
npx playwright test --project=mobile-chrome
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port 3000 already in use
```bash
# Kill the dev server on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
```

### Browsers not installed
```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
```

### Tests timeout
- Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts`
- Check if dev server starts: `npm run dev`

### Visual regression fails
```bash
# Update baseline screenshots
npx playwright test --update-snapshots
```

## Performance

- **84 tests** run in approximately **2-3 minutes** (with mocks)
- Real API tests would take 10-15 minutes and cost $$$
- Visual regression tests add ~30 seconds

## Next Steps

1. **Run the tests**: `npm run test:e2e:ui`
2. **Review test coverage**: See `tests/README.md`
3. **Add more tests**: Use codegen to record new tests
4. **Customize**: Edit `playwright.config.ts` for your needs

## Documentation

- Full test documentation: `tests/README.md`
- Playwright docs: https://playwright.dev
- Test examples: See any `.spec.ts` file

## Summary

Comprehensive Playwright testing setup complete with:
- 84 E2E tests across 8 test suites
- Full API mocking for fast, free tests
- Visual regression testing
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Interactive UI mode for debugging
- Automatic screenshots and videos on failure

All tests use mocked responses - no Gemini API key needed to run tests!
